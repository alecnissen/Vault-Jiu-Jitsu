<h1>About This Project</h1> 
This project aimed to enhance my local jiu-jitsu school's website through a comprehensive refactor, integrating improved styling, animations, and instructor bios, while showcasing the school's amenities like the sauna and cold plunge. Developed with ReactJS, it provided valuable practice with React hooks such as state, effects, and refs, as well as CSS animations for engaging fade-in and slide-in effects.
